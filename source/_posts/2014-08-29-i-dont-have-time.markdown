Is there something you'd like to create? A project you want to build? A goal you want to achieve?

With the likes of [Malcolm Gladwell][mg] and [Peter Norvig][pn] telling us that it takes
thousands of hours and many years to master something, your dreams and ambitions can 
easily stall as reality sinks in.

How do you get the inertia to start when the finish line seems so far away?

> I'd like to write a book, but I don't have time to do all that work.

But do you have an hour to outline a table of contents? Could you write 500
words today? How about emailing five bloggers that might be interested in reviewing your
book this week?

[Nathan Barry][nb], a normal guy from Idaho with a wife and kid, found the time to write 
his book in [thousand word chunks][book].

> I'd really like to start drawing, but I'm no good and don't have time to learn.

Do you have time to draw one sketch today? And again tomorrow? Could you steal enough
time to read a chapter in a [book][drs] every week? To visit an art museum once a month?

[Jonathan Hardesty][jh], an aspiring artist who started at "rock bottom", did 
one sketch or painting [every day][paint]. It took him years of work, but he went
from untrained to professional artist.

> I love documentaries and want to make my own someday, but I don't think I'll ever find the time.

Can you send an email to a subject you want to interview today? Could you edit just one 
interview this week? Do you have a free weekend to film B-roll next month?

[Tim Cawley][tc], with a day job in advertising, squeezed in work on nights, early 
mornings, and holiday breaks for two years to complete [his documentary][fns]. It's now
showing at film festivals across the country.

Gradual progress is crazy powerful. 

When you frame something as a giant, amorphous task (get healthy, become a designer, 
start a business) &mdash; it can seem impossible to fit into your busy schedule.

Break it down into smaller pieces that you do have time for. 

With time and determination, the **impossible** will become the **inevitable**.

总是觉得自己心比天高，命比纸薄。想学好多东西，也总有无从下手，觉得自己既没有天分，又下不了决心。其实是不够勇敢，执行力不够，再加拖延。正如文章所述：循序渐进的力量异常强大。当你规划某些庞大，杂乱无杂的计划时，你根本不可能将这些事加入你的“满满”的时间表中。但是如果你将他们分解，细化成你可以抽时间去做的小任务，再加上一点点时间和不放弃的决心，**不可能**就会成为**必然**
